Sofer_Mahir ontology (Hebrew literary Manuscripts)

All lines have to be in some form of region.
All Hebrew lines are toplines
IF a word is in the margins directly before or after the main textline and belongs at this place it is part of the maintextline even if it is in the same hand as all other marginal additions.
IF an addition starts as interlinear addition and goes out into the margins I consider it as marginal if the central point is outside the main region and as interlinear if it is not. If it is followed by more lines in the margin, I consider it as first line of a marginal addition. In this case the "Margin" region goes into the "Main" region.

	a. Regions
		i.	Main (default)
		ii.	Commentary (default)
		iii.	Illustration (default)
		iv.	Title (default) : I have used it but there are so few examples that I prefer to regroup it under Paratext, below).
		v.	Margin (anything belonging to main text that is not paratext, i.e. principally marginal additions)
		vi.	Paratext (Running header, catchwords, marginal numbers, scribbling)
		vii. Hole (I have experimented with this but not reached a conclusions about its utility).
		
  b.	Lines
		i.	Default (also lines inside illustrations, e.g.)
		ii.	Correction : Originally only interlinear corrections, but now also all lines that are not in main. According to my experience the system learns MUCH better to distinguish main lines from marginal lines and not combining them if the lines in the margin have a different type. While this voids the possibility to distinguish interlinear corrections from normal lines inside marginal notes, this is very rare and the general segmentation is much much better.
 		iii.	Numbering: 
			1.	Small letters used as numbers above words where the letters indicate the reordering for transpositions.
			2.	Marginal numbers in paratext regions on the margins. Such numbers mostly indicate versification. I do NOT use it for visually indistinguishable numbering of passages inside the main text or inside marginal annotations. Only if the numbers are apart from other stuff.
