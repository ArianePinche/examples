## Definition

**Margin:** caracterises any **text zone* contained in the margins (upper, lower, inner or outer), including the space between two columns, whatever their semantic status (gloss, additions, â€¦).

## Justification

Distinguishing between Main and Margin text, though limited from a semantic point of view, is a practical approach.

## Problems and challenges

- Should additions be treated separately ? If yes, why ?
- Should it include critical apparatus, notes, etc. ?
