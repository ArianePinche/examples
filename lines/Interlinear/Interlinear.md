## Definition

**Interlinear:** caracterises a line that is not a standard text line, but as been added between two of them, for instance to include a forgotten word.

## Justification

Interlinear corrections are fairly common, and not part of the original reading order of line succession. They usually need to be reintegrated somewhere inside a default line.
