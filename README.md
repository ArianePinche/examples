This repository contains examples, to help establish and illustrate an ontology of layout analysis and segmentation.

Each submission is made in a separate folder, and contains:

- an image file;
- a markdown file, describing the different zones and lines that are encountered, and signaling issues;
- (NOT FOR NOW): an Alto file implementing the example in the ontology. 

Submit to main by creating a branch and making a pull request.
